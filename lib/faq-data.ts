    question: 'Who does Zynra Studio work with?',
    answer: 'We work with early-stage AI founders: pre-launch to early traction. Solo founders and small teams building AI products. We focus on product completion, AI UX and conversion, and GEO visibility. We don\'t target enterprise.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "activation" mean?',
    answer: 'Activation means getting your product to a state where it converts and reaches real users. For us that includes: finishing advanced features so you can ship, making your AI workflow intuitive and conversion-focused, and making your product visible in generative search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.).',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is GEO and why does it matter?',
    answer: 'GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is about being discoverable where AI answers are generated — in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and similar tools. We help with entity structure, answer-based content, and AI engine discoverability so your product shows up when people ask relevant questions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the engagement work?',
    answer: 'We start with a Founder Strategy Call to align on where you\'re stuck. Then we scope a focused engagement — product completion, AI UX and conversion, or GEO — in clear phases. No long lock-in or vague retainers. You stay in control of scope and budget.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you help with technical build as well as UX?',
    answer: 'Yes. We do advanced feature implementation, AI agent architecture, integrations (OpenAI, Supabase, Stripe), and performance optimization. We also redesign onboarding, demo experiences, and landing pages for conversion. It depends on what you need.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get started?',
    answer: 'Book a Founder Strategy Call via our contact page. We\'ll discuss your situation, where you\'re stuck, and whether we\'re a fit. From there we define outcomes and next steps.',
  },
