# Email Avatar/Logo Setup Guide

The email avatar (the image that appears next to your email in the inbox) is controlled by email clients and services, not by the email HTML itself. Here's how to set it up:

## Option 1: Gravatar (Recommended for Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

Gravatar is the most widely supported method for email avatars:

1. **Create a Gravatar account:**
   - Go to [https://gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com)
   - Sign up with your email address: `contact@zynra.studio`
   - Upload your logo/avatar image (square, at least 512x512px recommended)
   - Verify your email address

2. **Benefits:**
   - Works across most email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
   - Automatically displays your logo when sending from `contact@zynra.studio`
   - Free and widely supported

## Option 2: Resend Domain Branding

Resend allows you to configure branding for your domain:

1. **In Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Resend dashboard
   - Navigate to **Domains** → Select your domain (`zynra.studio`)
   - Look for **Branding** or **Logo** settings
   - Upload your logo image
   - This may require a paid Resend plan

2. **Check Resend Documentation:**
   - Visit: [https://resend.com/docs](https://resend.com/docs)
   - Search for "avatar" or "logo" settings

## Option 3: Email Client Specific Settings

Some email clients have their own profile picture settings:

- **Gmail:** Settings → General → Profile picture
- **Outlook:** Account settings → Profile picture
- **Apple Mail:** System Preferences → Internet Accounts

Note: These only affect how emails appear in your own client, not for recipients.

## Current Status

Currently, emails are sent from `contact@zynra.studio`. The avatar shown (like the "Z" letter) is likely:
- A default placeholder from the email client
- A Gravatar if one exists for that email
- A profile picture if set in the email client

## Recommended Action

**Set up a Gravatar** for `contact@zynra.studio` - this is the easiest and most universal solution that will work across all major email clients.

## Logo in Email Body

If you want to add your logo **inside the email body** (not as the avatar), you can:
1. Host your logo image (e.g., `https://zynra.studio/logo-icon.svg`)
2. Add it to the email template HTML
3. Reference it in the template using an `<img>` tag

Would you like me to add a logo image to the email template header?
